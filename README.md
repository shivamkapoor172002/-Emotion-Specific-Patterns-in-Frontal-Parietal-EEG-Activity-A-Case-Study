## Project Overview

Emotions play a crucial role in human experience, shaping our thoughts and actions. This project investigates how different emotional stimuli evoke distinct patterns of brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG). The study focused on three specific emotions: devotion, fear, and joy, elicited by videos related to patriotism, horror, and comedy, respectively.

### Key Findings
- **Theta Activity in Frontal Lobe:** Increased during the horror video, suggesting heightened vigilance and threat appraisal.
- **Theta and Gamma Activity in Parietal Lobe:** Increased during the patriotic video, indicating enhanced sensory processing and positive emotional engagement.
- **Alpha Power:** Elevated throughout the brain during the comedy video, reflecting a relaxed state.

### Keywords
EEG, Emotions, Brain Activity, Frontal Lobe, Parietal Lobe

## Abstract
Understanding the neural basis of emotion processing is vital for fields ranging from psychology to neuroscience. This case study employed EEG to explore emotion-specific brain activity in response to different emotional stimuli. Power spectral density (PSD) analysis was performed on EEG data collected from a single subject exposed to videos designed to elicit distinct emotional responses.
